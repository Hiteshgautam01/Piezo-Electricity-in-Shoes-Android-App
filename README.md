As wearable electronic devices evolve and proliferate, there will be a growing need for more power
delivery to distributed points around the human body. Today, much of that storage is provided by
batteries and power delivery is via wires. The current approach to power distribution is clearly
becoming problematic -- as more appliances are carried, we are forced to either use more small
batteries that require replacement everywhere or run wires through our clothing to supply appliances
from a central power source. Both are undesirable. A better solution is clearly to generate power where
it is being used, bypassing the storage and distribution problem altogether. As power requirements
drop for most wearable devices, it is no longer infeasible to harvest a useful amount of energy
&quot;parasitically&quot; from a normal range of human activity.
Many attempts have been made in the past to tap this source, leading to the consideration of a host of
technologies ranging from the construction of various electromechanical generators to the surgical
placement of piezoelectric material in animals. No generating system to date has served all of the needs
of wearable computingâ€”light weight, minimum effort, high power generation, convenient power
delivery, and good power regulation. We believe that our approach has the potential to solve these
problems for a class of wearable devices by placing both the generator and powered electronics in a
location where considerable energy is easily available, namely the shoe.
In previous studies, it has been calculated that up to 67 Watts of power are available from heel strikes
during a brisk walk (68 kg person, 2 steps/sec, heel moving 5 cm). This level of power extraction from
walking would certainly interfere greatly with one&#39;s gait. Our philosophy, in contrast, has been to try to
generate power entirely parasitically, that is through mechanisms that capture and make use of energy
normally dissipated wastefully into the environment. There is much less energy of this type than
available through deliberate means of harvesting human power (e.g. through a hand crank or foot
pedal), but it is our goal to unobtrusively collect energy for low-power applications. We have
approached this problem by using the energy from the weight transfer during a step to perform useful
work.
